I reseted my server, so the website is changed, the new one is
http://wd-env.pwxmrjtsic.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/index.html
if the website showes "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/wsgi/.uszipcode' "please contact me ASAPï¼Œ this error caused by AWS server, some times it will happen,I did not find a way to solve it permanent. but I could solve it temporary after you contacted me.
